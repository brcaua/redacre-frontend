## Application role

**Widget roles**
This application is a widget that displays the rates of the currencies and cryptocurrencies mentioned above.

For this, it uses the [Coin Gecko API](https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/) via React Query to get the rates and display them very quickly.

* [x] The currencies allowed are: **ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ USD, ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ GBP,ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º EUR, ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ JPY, ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· BRL**

* [x] The cryptocurrencies allowed are: **ðŸª™ BTC, ðŸª™ LTC, ðŸª™ RPL, ðŸª™ ETH**

A example of use is:
1. In the moment of writing this, the rate of 1 BTC to USD is 21.500,00
  1. So, if you want to know how much is 1 BTC to USD, you just need to select the cryptocurrency and the currency with the values that you want to convert. So, quickly, you will see the result.

**Table roles**
This application is a table that displays the rates of the currencies and cryptocurrencies mentioned above.

* The data
 There rates are created by the backend service in Nest.js that stores the rates in a MongoDB database.

  For this case, we use the port `3000/currency` to access the backend service and get all the historical rates.

* Filter
  It's possible to filter the rates by Live Price type for now. The types are: `Live Price` and `Exchanged`.

* Sort
  It's possible to sort the rates by the column selected.

* Pagination
  It's possible to paginate the rates conforming the page size, the page number and filter selected.

**Styling**

The styling was made using Material UI and CSS.

The desktop version is responsive and the mobile version is not responsive completely.

To set the colours I followed the Figma design mentioned in the challenge.
